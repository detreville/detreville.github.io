    I started an old blog a few years ago using Jekyll, but I grew tired of wondering whether Jekyll would be maintained very far into the future. I've finally switched to Publii instead; it seems a little more modern. We'll see!

    When I publish a post, I intend not to update it. If an existing post needs updates, I'll mark up the post to show what has been changed.

<p>I'm hosting my blog on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages | Websites for you and your projects, hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a>. It's dead-simple and free.</p>
<p>I started an old blog a few years ago using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll â€¢ Simple, blog-aware, static sites | Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll</a>, but I grew tired of wondering whether Jekyll would be maintained very far into the future. I've finally switched to <a href="https://getpublii.com/" title="Static Site CMS to build privacy-focused, fast and SEO-friendly website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii</a> instead; it's a different static site generator and seems a little more modern. We'll see!</p>
<p>I intend to add posts at the rate of about one a week. (I'm retired and have nothing else to do.)</p>
