            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Today is Father's Day in the US, so this blog post is about fatherhood. I started composing this blog post in my head as I slept in late this morning—without any small children jumping up and down on top of me like in the good old days—but writing it all down took a little more skill than I expected, because of course. At least it isn't midnight yet.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    My wife Laurie and I have two sons; one is 23 years old and one is 22½. Since they'd be horribly embarrassed to see their names here—each for his own excellent reasons—I'll just write \"our first son\" and \"our second son,\" respectively.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    We adopted both our sons at their births, which is why their ages differ by only 7 months and 11 days. (Pro Tip to Self: Think \"7-Eleven\" to recall this, but don't ever mention such a silly shortcut to anyone.) It's incredibly difficult to raise two children so close in age, but you don't have to change diapers, then stop changing diapers for a while, then have to start all over again.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This post is about our first son, since that was when my fatherhood began.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I'm a lifelong techie. I'd long ago read Richard Dawkin's theory that parents love and protect their children because the parents and the children share genes, and because our genes control our behavior, and so and so on. If my son shares half my chromosomes, and he's suddenly in mortal danger, my genes might decide that saving him is worth sacrificing myself, assuming that doing so gives my son's copies of those very same crafty genes a better chance to live on. It's a very simple explanation of very complex behavior, so it made complete sense (to me).\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    But what about adoption? I knew our adopted children and I would share <i>lots</i> of genes—like most humans, if I understand vertebrate zoology—but <i>not</i> as many as regular old biological parents do. Also, while biological parents get several months to prepare themselves for parenthood, pre-bonding with their imminent offspring, we didn't learn that yes, we'd soon have a son until just over a week before he was born. It was enough time to buy a car seat and cute baby clothes, but would I have enough time to pre-bond too? (My wife would know what to do, I was sure, but I was just the father, and a techie to boot. I had a Ph.D. in Computer Science, but I couldn't quite see how that helped.)\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/3CEE2715-65D8-4061-8E4C-F34FC467C16E_1_201_a.jpeg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/3CEE2715-65D8-4061-8E4C-F34FC467C16E_1_201_a-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/3CEE2715-65D8-4061-8E4C-F34FC467C16E_1_201_a-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/3CEE2715-65D8-4061-8E4C-F34FC467C16E_1_201_a-md.jpeg 768w ,https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/3CEE2715-65D8-4061-8E4C-F34FC467C16E_1_201_a-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/3CEE2715-65D8-4061-8E4C-F34FC467C16E_1_201_a-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/3CEE2715-65D8-4061-8E4C-F34FC467C16E_1_201_a-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"  height=\"1425\" width=\"1416\" alt=\"Album cover, \"Paul Simon With Bob Dylan: Summer of 1999\"\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    It was the Summer of 1999 and the early days of dad-rock. We already had tickets for a big outdoor concert on Sunday night—Bob Dylan and Paul Simon!—and we knew his due date was Monday. I figured we'd see the concert, then drive straight to the local hospital where he'd be born. Great plan; too bad it didn't work.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/D0CDBBF1-8DBE-4E9C-922D-B95B5F4F5EA4_1_201_a-2.jpeg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/D0CDBBF1-8DBE-4E9C-922D-B95B5F4F5EA4_1_201_a-2-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/D0CDBBF1-8DBE-4E9C-922D-B95B5F4F5EA4_1_201_a-2-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/D0CDBBF1-8DBE-4E9C-922D-B95B5F4F5EA4_1_201_a-2-md.jpeg 768w ,https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/D0CDBBF1-8DBE-4E9C-922D-B95B5F4F5EA4_1_201_a-2-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/D0CDBBF1-8DBE-4E9C-922D-B95B5F4F5EA4_1_201_a-2-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://detreville.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/D0CDBBF1-8DBE-4E9C-922D-B95B5F4F5EA4_1_201_a-2-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"  height=\"1116\" width=\"1440\" alt=\"The Sony VAIO PCG-C1 Picturebook, with built-in camera\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    It was late the <i>next</i> day when the call came in.
